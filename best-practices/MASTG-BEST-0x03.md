Expose a [broadcast receiver](https://developer.android.com/guide/components/broadcasts) to other apps only when it genuinely needs to receive broadcasts from them, and don't send sensitive data in broadcasts that other apps can read. Both the receiving and sending sides of a broadcast are part of the app's attack surface.

- **Set `android:exported` explicitly.** Declare [`android:exported="false"`](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/receiver-element#exported) on every manifest receiver that doesn't need to receive broadcasts from other apps. An [`<intent-filter>`](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/intent-filter-element) historically makes a receiver exported unless you set the attribute, and since Android 12 (API level 31) the attribute must be set explicitly when an intent filter is present. See [Insecure broadcast receivers](https://developer.android.com/privacy-and-security/risks/insecure-broadcast-receiver).
- **Mark context-registered receivers correctly.** When registering a receiver at runtime with [`Context.registerReceiver`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/content/Context#registerReceiver(android.content.BroadcastReceiver,%20android.content.IntentFilter)), pass `RECEIVER_NOT_EXPORTED` unless the receiver must accept broadcasts from other apps. This is required since Android 13 (API level 33) for receivers of non-system broadcasts.
- **Require a permission.** Restrict who can deliver to a receiver with [`android:permission`](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/receiver-element#prmsn), and restrict who can read a broadcast you send by passing a `receiverPermission` to [`sendBroadcast`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/content/Context#sendBroadcast(android.content.Intent,%20java.lang.String)).
- **Don't broadcast sensitive data implicitly.** Don't put sensitive data (for example, credentials, tokens, or personal information) in an implicit broadcast. Send it with an explicit target package or component, or use an in-app mechanism such as [`LiveData`](https://developer.android.com/reference/androidx/lifecycle/LiveData) instead of a system broadcast. See [Security considerations and best practices](https://developer.android.com/guide/components/broadcasts#security-and-best-practices).
- **Avoid sticky broadcasts.** Don't use the deprecated sticky broadcast methods; they persist after delivery and provide no access control. See [Sticky broadcasts](https://developer.android.com/privacy-and-security/risks/sticky-broadcast).
- **Validate incoming intent data.** Treat all data in a received `Intent` as untrusted and validate it before use.
