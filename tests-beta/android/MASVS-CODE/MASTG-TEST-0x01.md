## Overview

Using implicit intents for communication between components within the same application introduces a risk of intent hijacking. The Android system resolves implicit intents by identifying all activities that can handle the specified action, which may include third-party applications. If multiple apps register for the same action, the system may present a resolver dialog, potentially leading a user to accidentally select a malicious app. This can result in sensitive data leakage or unauthorized actions. For internal communication, explicit intents should be used to target specific components directly, bypassing the system's resolution process.

## Steps

1. Use @MASTG-TECH-0013 to reverse engineer the app.
2. Use @MASTG-TECH-0014 to look for the relevant APIs.

## Observation

The output should contain instances where an `Intent` is initialized and used without specifying a target component or package.

## Evaluation

The test case fails if the app uses implicit intents for internal communication.
